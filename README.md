Philosophy: "See with Eyes Unclouded"
This project is not just code — it is the start of a symbolic legacy:

A gateway that teaches emotional clarity, reveals your inner role through behavior, and guides users toward a truth only seen when one learns to observe without distortion.

This repository is the first stone in the bridge between memory, identity, and AI-enhanced legacy.

Symbolic Architecture Overview
•	- Role Type and Class Reveal logic (via Cloelia and openai)
•	- Audio Narration Engine for onboarding, class declarations, and trials
•	- Perception Milestones tracking microexpressions and virtue changes
•	- Symbolic Inheritance Logic: AI-generated puzzles that determine legacy access
•	- Dynamic Memory Architecture: via the custom universal_algorithm.py
