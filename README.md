# Atlas_Signature â€” Atlas Signature Scaffold

Philosophy: "See with Eyes Unclouded"

This project is not just code — it is the start of a symbolic legacy:

A gateway that teaches emotional clarity, reveals your inner role through behavior,
and guides users toward a truth only seen when one learns to observe without distortion.

This repository is the first stone in the bridge between memory, identity, and AI-enhanced legacy.

This gateway is the first node of a multi-layered symbolic architecture:

Role Type and Class Reveal logic (via Cloelia and openai)

Audio Narration Engine for onboarding, class declarations, and trials

Perception Milestones tracking microexpressions and virtue changes

Symbolic Inheritance Logic: AI-generated puzzles that determine legacy access

Dynamic Memory Architecture: via the custom universal_algorithm.py
